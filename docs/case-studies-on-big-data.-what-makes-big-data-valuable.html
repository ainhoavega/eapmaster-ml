<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> Case studies on Big Data. What makes Big Data valuable?<a href="case-studies-on-big-data.-what-makes-big-data-valuable.html#case-studies-on-big-data.-what-makes-big-data-valuable" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p>Broadly speaking, we can think of several main areas where Big Data is being used in practice:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Customer targeting</strong>. Big data is used to better understand customers and their behaviors and preferences. Typical examples include Walmart (<a href="https://www.projectpro.io/article/how-big-data-analysis-helped-increase-walmarts-sales-turnover/109">1</a>, <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/innovation/20170807/5-ways-walmart-uses-big-data-to-help-customers">2</a>) and Target (<a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/target-leans-on-data-science-to-solve-extremely-large-retail-problems/569198/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.retailcustomerexperience.com/articles/target-talks-digital-signage-using-big-data-to-deliver-a-personalized-experience/">2</a>), who could predict their customers’ pregnancies and offer tailored coupon books.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Business process optimization</strong>. From supply chain to delivery route optimization, businesses are optimizing their logistics and stocks using geographic positioning and radio frequency identification (RFID) sensors to track goods or delivery vehicles and optimize routes by integrating live traffic data, etc (<a href="https://dzone.com/articles/big-data-in-retail-industry-real-world-uses-and-ex-1">see for example</a>). HR business processes <a href="https://www.aihr.com/blog/hr-analytics-case-studies/">are also being improved using big data analytics</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Healthcare</strong>. Big data analytics computing power allows us to decode entire DNA strings in minutes, enabling us to find new cures and better understand and predict disease patterns. Consider what happens when all of the individual data collected by smart watches and wearable devices is applied to millions of people and their various diseases. Clinical trials in the future will not be limited by small sample sizes, but may include everyone. (<a href="https://www.datapine.com/blog/big-data-examples-in-healthcare/">read some examples</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sports performance</strong>. The majority of elite sports have now adopted big data analytics. We have the <a href="https://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/scores/stats/1701.html">IBM SlamTracker</a> tool for tennis tournaments; we use video analytics to track the performance of every player in a football or baseball game; and sensor technology in sports equipment such as basket balls or golf clubs allows us to get feedback on our game and how to improve it (via smart phones and cloud servers). Many elite sports teams track athletes even <em>outside</em> of the athletic environment, using smart technology to track nutrition and sleep, as well as social media conversations to monitor emotional well-being.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Science and research</strong>. The CERN, the nuclear physics lab with the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator, has 65,000 processors to analyze the data center’s 30 petabytes of data. To analyze the data, however, it employs the computing power of thousands of computers distributed across 150 data centers worldwide (<a href="https://home.cern/science/computing">link</a>). Such computing power has the potential to transform many other fields of science and research (<a href="https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/big-data-challenge-large-hadron-collider/11359/">link</a>)
However, Big Data computing power could be applied to any set of data, providing scientists with new sources. <em>Researchers can now more easily access and analyze Census data and other government-collected data to create bigger and better pictures of our health and social sciences.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Machine and device performance optimization</strong>. Big Data tools (specifically, advanced Neural Networks models) are used to operate <a href="https://neptune.ai/blog/self-driving-cars-with-convolutional-neural-networks-cnn">Google’s self driving car</a> (and so do other brands such as Toyota or Tesla). In Ireland, grocery chain <a href="https://www.analyticssteps.com/blogs/5-ways-tesco-uses-big-data-analytics">Tesco</a> has its warehouse employees wear armbands that track the goods they take from the shelves, distributes tasks, and even forecasts completion time for a job.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security and law enforcement</strong>. Law enforcement agencies all over the world already use Big Data to foil terrorist plots (e.g. the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/09/27/national-security-relies-more-and-more-on-big-data-heres-why/">NSA</a>), predict criminal activity or catch them. <a href="https://supplychaindigital.com/technology/how-american-express-uses-big-data-transform-operations">Credit card companies</a> use Big Data to detect fraudulent transactions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>City organization</strong>. <a href="https://poonamrao.medium.com/transport-for-london-tfl-leverages-big-data-to-enhance-customer-enga-ae13cfe1fcd0">The City of London uses Big Data</a> to organize their public transport system; <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3837/tiis.2020.02.021">Los Angeles uses road sensors and traffic camaras</a> to control traffic lights and manipulate the flow/congestion of traffic; <a href="https://www.rfid-wiot-search.com/solution-search/compta-waste-management-in-portugal-optimized-with-rfid">Portugal has waste management sensors in some cities</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Financial trading</strong>. Today, the majority of equity trading is done through data algorithms that use signals from social media networks and news websites to make buy and sell decisions in split seconds (<a href="https://www.analyticssteps.com/blogs/how-big-data-revolutionizing-trading">link</a>).</p></li>

<p>The streaming service Netflix accounts for 35% of peak-time Internet traffic in the US, and the service now has 222 million subscribers in over 190 countries enjoying more than 6 billion hours of TV shows and movies per month. This amounts to almost 300GB of streaming per user per month. Data from these millions of subscribers is collected and monitored in an attempt to understand our viewing habits.</p>

<p>A quick glance at their <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/search?q=data">jobs posts page</a> tells us that they take their Big Data very seriously. However, at their core, their business has consisted of them correctly predicting what users will enjoy watching. Big Data analytics is the fuel that fires the “recom- mendation engines” designed to serve this purpose.</p>
<p>This started in 2006 (whilst they were still a DVD subscription business; streaming began a year later) with the launch of the $1 million Netflix prize to whomever could come up with the best algorithm to predict how their customers would rate a movie based on their previous ratings. The winning entry was announced in 2009 and key principles of it are still used. <em>Note: you can check out the dataset used here at <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data">Kaggle</a> and read more on the Netflix prize <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/the-netflix-prize">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Analysts were initially constrained by a lack of information on their customers, with only four data points (customer ID, movie ID, rating, and date watched) available for analysis. As streaming became the primary method of delivery, many new data points about their customers became available (e.g. now they can observe when someone stops a movie or replays a section – or only watches two minute of it and never comes back). With this new information, Netflix was able to create models that predicted the perfect storm scenario of customers being consistently served with movies they would enjoy. After all, satisfied customers are far more likely to renew their subscriptions.</p>
<p>Tagging is another important component of Netflix’s attempt to provide us with films that we will enjoy. The company pays people to watch movies and then tag them with movie elements. They will then recommend that you watch other productions that are tagged similarly to those you are watching. This is where the sometimes unusual “suggestions” come from.</p>
<p>Netflix’s ultimate goal is to increase the number of hours customers spend using their service. Statistics aren’t really needed to tell you that viewers who don’t spend much time using the service are likely to feel they aren’t getting value for money from their subscriptions and may cancel them. To that end, the impact of various factors on “quality of experience” is closely monitored, and models are developed to investigate how this affects user behavior. Calculations about data placement can be made to ensure an optimal service to as many homes as possible by collecting end-user data on how the physical location of the content affects the viewer’s experience.</p>

<p>Data on what titles customers watch, what time of day movies are watched, time spent selecting movies, how often playback is stopped (either by the user or due to network limitations), and ratings given feed the recommendation algorithms and content decisions. Netflix collects data on buffering delays (rebuffer rate) and bitrate (which affects picture quality), as well as customer location, to analyze quality of experience.</p>

<p>Although their vast library of movies and TV shows is hosted in the cloud on Amazon Web Services (AWS), it is also mirrored by ISPs and other hosts around the world. In addition to improving user experience by reducing lag when streaming content around the world, this lowers costs for ISPs by saving them the cost of downloading data from the Netflix server before passing it on to viewers at home.
Their catalog was said to be three petabytes in size in 2013. This massive amount of data is explained by the need to store many of their titles in up to 120 different video formats due to the variety of devices that support Netflix playback. It now amounts to more than 17,000 titles worldwide.
Their systems used Oracle databases at first, but they switched to NoSQL and Cassandra to allow for more complex, Big Data-driven analysis of unstructured data.
Kurt Brown, who leads Netflix’s Data Platform team, spoke at the Strata + Hadoop World conference about how the company’s data platform is constantly evolving. Netflix’s data infrastructure incorporates Big Data technologies such as Hadoop, Hive, and Pig, as well as traditional business intelligence tools such as Teradata and MicroStrategy. It also includes Lipstick and Genie, two open-source applications and services developed by Netflix. And, like the rest of Netflix’s core infrastructure, it is hosted in the AWS cloud. In the future, Netflix will investigate Spark for streaming, machine learning, and analytic use cases, as well as continue to develop new components for their own open-source suite.</p>

<p>All of this data had to be quantified in some way in order to be available for computer analysis and thus unlock its value. Netflix accomplished this by paying teams of thousands of viewers to sit through hours of content, meticulously tagging elements they discovered.</p>
<p>Nowadays, they have incorporated AI into this process by developing routines that can take a Jpeg snapshot of the content and analyze what is happening on screen using sophisticated technologies such as facial recognition and color analysis. These snapshots can be taken at predetermined intervals or whenever a user performs a specific action, such as pausing or stopping playback. For example, if it knows a user has a habit of switching off after watching gory or sexual scenes, it can recommend more sedate alternatives the next time they sit down to watch something.</p>

<p>For networks, distributors, and producers, predicting what viewers will want to watch next is big business (all roles that Netflix now fill in the media industry). Netflix has taken the lead, but competitors such as HBO, Amazon, Apple, … have their own analytics, even though Netflix is still leader. As time passes, we can expect to see continued innovation in predictive content programming, driven by fierce competition.
Netflix really begun to lay the groundwork for “personalized TV.”</p>
